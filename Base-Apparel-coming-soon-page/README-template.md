# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page solution

This is day 5 of learning Javascript. I used 375px for mobile and 1440px for desktop.

This is a solution to the [Base Apparel coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid and its properties. This project is almost the same as the previous one so making this went smoothly.
